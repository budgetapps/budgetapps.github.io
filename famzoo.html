                    <h2>About FamZoo</h2>
                    <p>FamZoo is an award-winning <strong>virtual family bank</strong> designed to help parents teach their children the fundamentals of earning, saving, spending, and giving. By providing a safe, controlled environment, FamZoo allows kids to learn from their financial mistakes while the stakes are still low. The system works like a "private family bank" where the parents act as the bankers and the children are the customers.</p>
                    <p>Unlike traditional banking apps, FamZoo focuses heavily on education and automation. Parents can set up automated allowances, tie rewards to chores, and even charge "parent-paid interest" on savings to demonstrate the power of compound growth. Whether you use their physical prepaid cards or their virtual ledger system, FamZoo provides the tools necessary to raise financially responsible adults.</p>
